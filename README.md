This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) programming puzzles.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow an advent calendar format. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is unlocked. Each puzzle consists of two parts, with the second part building upon the first.
